# p5.js

p5js is a game programming framework written for Javascript. It has an excellent [website](https://p5js.org/) with excellent [examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) and excellent [documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/).

This folder serves as a template for you to copy to your own projects and edit as needed. Rather than redoing all the excellent examples, I'd suggest starting [here](https://p5js.org/get-started/) and then continuing to the other tutorials [here](https://p5js.org/learn/).

## Actual code
The meat of the example is in `main.js` and `index.html`.
