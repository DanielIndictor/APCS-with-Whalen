# `if` statements

`if` statements are a foundational building block of programming and computing in general. There already exist many tutorials on how to use them so I'll just link a couple below and provide a syntax reference:

- [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
- [W3Schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)
- [If statement examples](https://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/tutorial/javascript/if-statements-js/)

# Syntax
Vanilla `if` statement:
```
if (CONDITION)
{
  // Your code here.
}
```

If-else statement:
```JavaScript
if (CONDITION)
{
  // Your code here.
} else
{
  // Code to run if the condition isn't true.
}

```
