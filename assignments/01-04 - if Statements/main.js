// In New York there are many milestone ages that you must reach to have access
// to various services. Below as an example exercise we're gonna write
// a program that tells you about some of the opportunities available to
// a person at a given age.

let age = 5;
console.log("You are " + age + " years old. This is what you can do:");

// To be eligible for military service you must be at least 17.
// If you're exactly 17 you need a parent's permission. We'll express this
// with the sequence of if statements below:
if (age == 17)
{
  console.log("You can join the military with a parent's permission.");
} else
{
  if (age > 17)
  {
  console.log("You're old enough to join the military if you so decide.");
  }
}
