# `let`, `var`, and `const`

As you write more code it will become harder and harder to manage. The only way to avoid this problem is to organize in advance and it is for that reason that you should learn about `let` and `const`.

## What about `var`?

In modern Javascript you should avoid `var` at all costs. Always prefer `let` and `const` where appropriate. `var` used to be the keyword JavaScript programmars used to declare variables in old versions of Javascript. However, ever since a modern version called "ES6" came out `var` has been made obsolete. The better scoping rules are why `let` is prefered.
