# Test Tips for the AP Computer Science Principles test

So. In theory this test shouldn't be all that difficult if you keep up with Whalen's curriculum. We hope to get through the entirety of the curriculum early in the school year. Below I'll detail some notes that we gathered looking at currently available materials for the AP curriculum.

Your first step should be to take a look at the [Assessment Overview and Assessment Format](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam). If you really wanna go ham you cah check out the [Curriculum Framework](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf).


## Explore Performance Task
The explore task is pretty easy. You just have to write an essay (or any kind of "visual, graphical, and/or audio content") that checks off all the boxes on the Curriculum Framework. You can choose an essay topic (usually about some new development in the field), do some research, and write about it. Watch out for the submission deadline.

## Create Performance Task
The "Create" Performance Task is a bit harder. You should read the Task Overview on page 79 of the Curriculum Framework linked above. The basic idea is that you should create a program or app that can either solve a problem (like automating a common task) or showcase creativity (like a simple game). You're required to submit one video no more than a minute in length or 30MB in size showcasing "the running of at least one significant feature of your program".

An important point I want to make is that the curriculum uses the words "algorithm" and "procedure" a lot. In the examples that Mr. Whalen and I have seen, this usually boils down the use of functions.

## End-of-Course Exam

Mr. Whalen plans to blow through most of the multiple choice topics very quickly, and if you were in his non-AP CS class you shouldn't have any problems. The exam is entirely multiple choice and topics cover the following (page 84 of Curriculum Framework):

- Abstraction
- Data and Information
- Algorithms
- Programming
- The Internet
- Global Impact

Unfortunately, there're no points for "creativity", though it is listed as a "big idea".
